                If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the
                great foodie moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds
                your expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking,
                chronicles of your food excursions â€“ they all count.

                While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your
                dining experiences, there are a few things we expect from
                every user on CloverShack. Your feedback, as well as your
                profile and the comments you share, are all subject to our
                Code of Conduct.

                If your activity on CloverShack doesn't match up to these
                content guidelines, we reserve the right to take action as we
                deem necessary. This could include altering or deleting your
                reviews or comments, or deleting your CloverShack account
                altogether, with or without notice. CloverShack also utilizes
                an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews.

            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

                    <p>
                        <b>Keep out the clutter:</b> To make sure we
                        collectively work towards building the
                        highest-quality content that's useful to everyone,
                        reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long.
                        That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's
                        convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you
                        cover the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't
                        fall short on characters. If you fill the space with
                        junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.

                        <b>Keep it relevant:</b> Please keep your
                        contributions relevant to CloverShack. Accounts
                        placing irrelevant, inappropriate, or promotional
                        content, that solicit customers, or that spam
                        restaurants, may be deleted without notice.

                        <b>Keep it clean:</b> Whether you're writing a
                        140-character snippet or a delightfully detailed
                        account of your meal, keep foul/abusive/hateful
                        language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just
                        like you, hate junk and will delete it whenever we
                        see it. This also includes (but is not limited to)
                        derogatory comments on someone's protected
                        characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or
                        indication of a personal vendetta against a business
                        and its associates.

                        <b>Seek help from the right people:</b> CloverShack
                        is a website with no claims to be a court of law or
                        a ministry of health. If you have a dispute with a
                        restaurant, or if you feel a restaurant does not
                        measure up to health codes, we encourage you to
                        contact the appropriate authorities directly.
                        CloverShack is not the appropriate platform for
                        reporting illegal activities, physical
                        confrontations, health code violations, or anything
                        under investigation by local governing bodies or
                        law-enforcement personnel. We encourage that such
                        accusations be reported to the concerned authorities
                        rather than being mentioned in reviews.

                    <p>
                        <b>Keep your listing updated:</b> While our team
                        makes every effort to keep information on
                        CloverShack up-to-date, we appreciate you letting us
                        know when an update is required. If your timings
                        change and your listing is not updated, customers
                        arriving late won't be too happy with you.

                    <p>
                        <b>Respond to criticism positively:</b> Take two
                        deep breaths when you get a negative review. Three,
                        if required. This happens to all restaurants who
                        have customers. These customers are always right,
                        even when they are wrong. Take the unflattering
                        reviews as constructive feedback and use it as an
                        opportunity to fix things. Whether you agree with
                        the feedback or not, take the criticism in good
                        stride. You can reply with a management response to
                        show you care, but please don't use this as a
                        platform to hit back or offer the customer an
                        incentive to edit their review. Your response can't
                        be edited after posting, so choose your words well.
